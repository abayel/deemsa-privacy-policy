<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Deemsa Hub / Daily Deemsa ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use our mobile application.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email, profile information (if provided).</li>
  <li><strong>User content:</strong> photos, videos, files, messages, comments, and other content you upload or share.</li>

  <li><strong>Camera & microphone access:</strong> when you use live video, meetings, or recording features.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage data & analytics:</strong> app interactions, feature usage, crash logs, performance data.</li>
  <li><strong>Device & log data:</strong> device model, OS version, language, IP address (where applicable), timestamps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide, operate, and maintain app features (social, chat, live, uploads, admin tools).</li>
  <li>Enable AI services such as translation, voice-to-text, and accessibility features (including sign-language support if available).</li>

  <li>Maintain safety and security, including moderation, reporting, and preventing abuse.</li>
  <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. AI & Accessibility Features</h2>
<p>
If you use AI features (e.g., language translation, voice recognition, accessibility tools), audio, video, or text may be processed
to deliver the requested functionality. We only process this data to provide the feature and to improve service reliability and safety.
</p>

<h2>4. Sharing & Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
We may use trusted third-party services to operate the app. These services may process data according to their own privacy policies.
Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Firebase Authentication, Firestore/Database, Firebase Storage, Firebase Analytics, Crash/Performance tools if enabled)</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud infrastructure</strong> for hosting and content delivery</li>
  <li><strong>AI service providers</strong> (only when you use AI features)</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not sell your personal information.
</p>

<h2>5. Location Data</h2>
<p>
Deemsa Hub does not publicly share your exact real-time location with other users unless you enable a feature that explicitly requires it.
If location is used for certain functions (for example delivery/transport features), it is handled according to your permissions and settings.
</p>

<h2>6. Content Moderation, Reporting, and Blocking</h2>
<p>
Because Deemsa Hub includes social and communication features, we provide tools to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Report users or user-generated content</li>
  <li>Block users or restrict interactions</li>
  <li>Moderate content and chats (manual and/or automated where available)</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We keep personal data only as long as necessary to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce policies.
Uploaded content may remain available until you delete it or request deletion, subject to legal requirements.
</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>
We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
</p>

<h2>9. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access / update:</strong> You may update certain information within the app.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You may request deletion of your account and associated data.</li>
